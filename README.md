# Obtain-Kanji-Info-from-jpdb.io-for-Mnemonic-generation

This is a userscript for the website https://jpdb.io. It inserts a button on the review page that, when clicked, copies information about the current kanji to the clipboard. This information includes the radicals that make up the kanji and the keyword associated with it.

## Usage

1. Install the script using a userscript manager like Tampermonkey. You can easily install it here --> https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/484815-obtain-kanji-info-from-jpdb-io-for-mnemonic-generation
2. Navigate to https://jpdb.io and learn new kanjis following the normal flow for it.
3. fter a new kanji is revealed, a new button will appear: "Copy Kanji Info for Mnemonic generation".
4. Click the button to copy the kanji information to your clipboard.
5. Paste the copied information into our Poe bot at https://poe.com/KanjiMnemonic to generate a mnemonic for the kanji. (You might need a premium account since currently only the best models are good enought for this task)
6. Go back to your tab for jpdb.io, and edit the kanji mnemonic and insert the new one you copied in poe


## Limitations

Currently I have only seen Claude2 and GPT4 be good enought for the task, so unless I get requests for a bot that can be used in the free tier in poe, I will leave it as how is it now
